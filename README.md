# Exploratory Data Analysis
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for different Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects performed on various datasets. EDA is a crucial step in understanding the underlying structure of the data, cleaning it, and deriving insights to help with model building or decision-making. In each notebook, we handle missing values, convert categorical data, identify outliers, and generate meaningful visualizations to explore relationships between variables.

# Black Friday EDA
The Black Friday dataset consists of transaction details for various customers during a Black Friday sale. The columns in the dataset include User_ID, Product_ID, Gender, Age, Occupation, City_Category, Stay_In_Current_City_Years, Marital_Status, Product_Category_1, Product_Category_2, Product_Category_3, and Purchase. After analyzing the dataset, columns with a high proportion of null values were dropped, and categorical string values were converted to numerical values using a mapping function. Null values were dealt with, and multiple bar plots such as Age vs Purchase, Occupation vs Purchase, and Product Category vs Purchase were created to gain insights into customer purchase behaviors.

# Flight EDA
The Flight dataset includes details of flight bookings in India, with columns such as Airline, Date_of_Journey, Source, Destination, Route, Dep_Time, Arrival_Time, Duration, Total_Stops, Additional_Info, and Price. After handling null values and dropping irrelevant columns, the Date_of_Journey was split into separate columns for Date, Month, and Year. Categorical variables were converted into numerical values using a mapping function. The Arrival_Time and Dep_Time columns were cleaned, and a new column calculating the total journey time in minutes was introduced. Various plots were created, including Price distribution by Airline, Price distribution by Source and Destination, and frequency distribution of total flight duration.

# Zomato EDA
The Zomato dataset contains information about restaurants, including columns like Restaurant ID, Name, Country Code, City, Address, Locality, Longitude, Latitude, Cuisines, Average Cost for Two, Currency, Has Table Booking, Has Online Delivery, Aggregate Rating, and Votes. After cleaning the dataset by dealing with null values and dropping less relevant columns, a grouping operation was performed on the Aggregate Rating, Rating Color, and Rating Text to analyze rating distribution. A plot was made for Aggregate Rating vs Rating Count, and city-wise distribution of orders within India was explored using a pie chart, as the majority of the entries were from India. The top 10 cuisines based on their ratings were identified and visualized.

# Football EDA
The Football dataset contains match-level information, including columns such as Season, Competition, Matchday, Date, Venue, Club, Opponent, Result, Playing_Position, Minute, At_Score, Type, and Goal_Assist. After handling missing values and cleaning the data, the Season column was standardized, and date values were converted to a consistent format. The dataset was sorted based on Season and Match Date. The match result scores were cleaned and formatted correctly, and a new column named Winner was added to indicate the winning team based on the match score. Visualizations included goal distribution by match minute, goal scoring distribution by playing position, and a head-to-head analysis of Real Madrid vs. Barcelona.
